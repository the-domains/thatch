# The Man the Founders Feared

> His entire campaign, from its very first moments, has been built on stoking anger, grievances and resentment against people of other races, religions and nationalities. 
> 
> Mexicans coming to America are rapists and drug dealers. Muslims hate America and need to be barred from it. Syrian refugees are "Trojan horses. \[...\] 
> 
> Mr. Trump's politics of hate is now metastasizing into violence. He incites people --- not all people to be sure, but enough. On social media in particular, one sees how he gives his supporters permission to express dark and ugly sentiments that existed before but were generally kept hidden from view.
